#### About Me
🎓 Educational Background: I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Research Methodology and Quantitative Methods – Data Science from Columbia University. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Data Science and Econ at University of California Berkeley.

💡 Technical Expertise: My technical toolkit includes Python (with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow), R, SQL, and various data visualization tools. I'm adept in machine learning, deep learning, statistical analysis, data mining, data analysis, and A/B testing.

🌐 Languages: Fluent in English and Mandarin, with elementary proficiency in Japanese.

#### Professional Experience
Data Science and Research: I have interned in roles focused on data science, data analytics and statistical analysis. My projects have ranged from implementing algorithms for audience optimization in marketing campaigns to statistical models for time series data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Developed a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model and utilized T5 models for answering product questions using contextual information from reviews. 

AI and LLM Research: Conducted sentiment analysis using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for consumer reviews, focusing on prompt engineering and LLM efficacy assessment. Also, finetuned models using the LORA approach for enhanced performance.

#### Academic Projects and Achievements
LLM-based Consumer Review Analysis: Conducted sentiment analysis using advanced NLP techniques and developed machine learning models for forecasting.

Kaggle Competitions: Actively participated in Kaggle competitions, notably in a Titanic Survival Prediction challenge where I applied various machine learning models and ensemble techniques.

#### Personal Interests
🌊 Scuba Diving and 🩰 Ballet: I enjoy exploring the underwater world through scuba diving and expressing myself through ballet and Chinese traditional dance.

📈 Quantitative Finance: Passionate about the intersection of data science and finance, particularly in algorithmic trading strategies.
